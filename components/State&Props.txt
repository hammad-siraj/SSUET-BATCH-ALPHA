                           state and props

• Each component can store its own local information in its “state”
– Private and fully controlled by the component
– Can be passed as props to children
• Only class components can have local state


• State declared within the
constructor:
class Menu extends Component {
constructor(props) {
super(props);
this.state = {
user: null
}
}
. . .
}




• State should only be modified
using setState()
onSelect(param) {
this.setState({
user: name
});
}
• Never do the following:
this.state.user=name ;



JSX attributes are passed into a component as a single object
– Available in the component as “props”
– Can pass in multiple attributes
– Cannot modify props within the component
• Examples:
